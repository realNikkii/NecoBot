# Neco-Bot
---
The almighty Neco-Arc from the hit game Melty Blood now comes in modern, never before seen, DISCORD BOT FORMAT. It can talk, and do some other stuff, it's hilarious! Really funny! Make it look for cool images! Or make it ***KILL*** your enemies! (Due to the government policies, I must say that this is actually ***not*** a function.)

Neco-Bot is made with Discord.js and Node.js, to run the code natively, you must first create a bot in the Discord Developer Portal, for more info click [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

Next, get Node.js by downloading it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/), afterwards initialise a folder for your bot, do so by typing `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm init` (depending on which you use) into the console, make sure you are in the directory you want to set up your bot in before doing this! Once you're done with that, proceed with...

```
npm install discord.js
```
Eventually, you will have to configure all of the config.json variables used in the code, so that they match yours.

Burunyu.
